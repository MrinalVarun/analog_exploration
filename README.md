# Single-Stage Amplifier — Cadence Simulation

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **single-stage amplifier** using **Cadence** tools.

## 📌 Key Highlights

- **✅ Schematic Design**  
  Designed a basic single-stage amplifier (common-source) to study analog gain behavior.

- **✅ AC Analysis**  
  Performed an AC sweep to observe the **magnitude gain vs. phase** response of the amplifier.

- **✅ Transient Simulation**  
  Verified input and output waveforms to confirm correct amplification and phase shift.

- **✅ Key Metrics Observed**
  - Midband gain
  - -3dB bandwidth
  -  phase shift across frequency

This project helps reinforce concepts of **small-signal gain**, **phase response**, and **frequency behavior** in analog amplifier design.
